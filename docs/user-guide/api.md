# API

Screwdriver APIs and the data models around them are documented via [Swagger]. This prevents out-of-date documentation, enables clients to be auto-generated, and most importantly exposes a human-readable interface.

> **Version 4** is the current API, all links should be prefixed with `/v4`.

Our API documentation can be found at [api.screwdriver.cd/v4/documentation](https://api.screwdriver.cd/v4/documentation). To see yours, go to `<API URL>/v4/documentation`.

## Using the API

### With Swagger
Swagger documentation includes examples and editable parameters to play around with. Visit the `/v4/documentation` page and use the interactive `Try it out!` buttons to make calls to our API.

Swagger page:
![Swagger page](./assets/swagger-page.png)

Response:
![Swagger response](./assets/swagger-response.png)

For more detailed documentation, click on the `Model` link.

Swagger model:
![Swagger model](./assets/swagger-model.png)

### Get a Bearer Token
1. After login to Screwdriver UI, you can go to [https://api.screwdriver.cd/v4/auth/token](https://api.screwdriver.cd/v4/auth/token) or your `<API URL>/v4/auth/token` to get a Bearer Token:
![Swagger Get Bearer Token](./assets/swagger-get-bearer-token.jpg)

2. Now go back [API documentation](https://api.screwdriver.cd/v4/documentation) or yours `<API URL>/v4/documentation`, click on the ðŸ”’ icon to the enter the Bearer Token, like the following:

![Swagger Use bearer token](./assets/swagger-use-bearer-token.png)


### With a REST Client
Use a REST client like [Postman] to make requests against the API. You will need an authorization token. To get an authorization token, login using `/v4/auth/login` and copy the token value when redirected to `/v4/auth/token`. See the [Authorization and Authentication](#authentication-and-authorization) section for more information.

Requests can be made to the API with headers like below:
```yaml
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>
```

Example request:
![Postman response](./assets/postman.png)

### With User or Pipeline tokens

For easy scripting with our API, we recommend using [tokens](./tokens).

#### Using Tokens to Authenticate
To authenticate with your newly created token, make a GET request to `https://${API_URL}/v4/auth/token?api_token=${YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE}`. This returns a JSON object with a token field. The value of this field will be a JSON Web Token, which you can use in an Authorization header to make further requests to the Screwdriver API. This JWT will be valid for 12 hours, after which you must re-authenticate.

#### Example: Starting a Pipeline
Hereâ€™s a short example written in Python showing how you can use an API token to start a pipeline. This script will directly call the Screwdriver API.

```python
# Authenticate with token
auth_request = get('https://api.screwdriver.cd/v4/auth/token?api_token=%s' % environ['SD_KEY'])
jwt = auth_request.json()['token']

# Set headers
headers = { 'Authorization': 'Bearer %s' % jwt }

# Get the jobs in the pipeline
jobs_request = get('https://api.screwdriver.cd/v4/pipelines/%s/jobs' % pipeline_id, headers=headers)
jobId = jobs_request.json()[0]['id']

# Start the first job
start_request = post('https://api.screwdriver.cd/v4/builds', headers=headers, data=dict(jobId=jobId))
```

For more information and examples, check out our [API documentation](https://api.screwdriver.cd/v4/documentation).

## Authentication and Authorization

For Authentication we're using [JSON Web Tokens] (JWTs) and Screwdriver API Tokens. JWTs need to be passed via
an `Authorization` header.
* To generate a JWT with OAuth, visit the `/v4/auth/login` endpoint, which will redirect you to the `/v4/auth/token` endpoint.
* To generate a JWT with a Screwdriver API Token, make a `GET` request to the `/v4/auth/token` endpoint with your API token as the `api_token` query parameter.

[Authorization](./authentication-authorization) is handled by your SCM. Screwdriver uses SCM user tokens
and identity to:

 - identify what repositories you have read, write, and admin access to
     - read allows you to view the pipeline
     - write allows you to start or stop jobs
     - admin allows you to create, edit, or delete pipelines
 - read the repository's `screwdriver.yaml`
 - enumerate the list of pull-requests open on your repository
 - update the pull-request with the success/failure of the build
 - add/remove repository web-hooks so Screwdriver can be notified on changes

For more information, see the [GitHub OAuth] documentation.

## Badges

To get an image that displays the current build statuses for a particular pipeline, you can use the URL `<your_UI_URL>/pipelines/<your_pipelineId>/badge`. To get it for job, you can use `<your_UI_URL>/pipelines/<your_pipelineId>/<jobName>/badge`.

[![Pipeline Status][status-image]][status-url] [![Job Status][job-status-image]][status-url]

[status-image]: https://cd.screwdriver.cd/pipelines/1/badge
[job-status-image]: https://cd.screwdriver.cd/pipelines/1/main/badge
[status-url]: https://cd.screwdriver.cd/pipelines/1

For example, we display the badge above by using this code in Markdown. The `status-image` URL gives you the badge image and the `status-url` should be the link to your pipeline.

```markdown
[![Pipeline Status][status-image]][status-url] [![Job Status][job-status-image]][status-url]

[status-image]: https://cd.screwdriver.cd/pipelines/1/badge
[job-status-image]: https://cd.screwdriver.cd/pipelines/1/main/badge
[status-url]: https://cd.screwdriver.cd/pipelines/1
```

## Design

Our API was designed with three principles in mind:

1. All interactions of user's data should be done through the API, so that
there is a consistent interface across the tools (CLI, Web UI, etc.).
1. Resources should be REST-ful and operations should be atomic so that intent
is clear and human readable.
1. API should be versioned and self-documented, so that client code generation
is possible.
