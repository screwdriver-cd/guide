# Environment
A set of key/value pairs for environment variables that need to available in a build. If an environment variable is set in both shared and a specific job, the value from the job configuration will be used.

## Limitations
- Nested environment variables do not work under the `environment` section.

#### Example

```
shared:
    template: example/mytemplate@stable
    environment:
        FOO: bar
        MYVAR: hello        # This will set MYVAR=hello in all builds
jobs:
    main:
        requires: [~pr, ~commit]
        environment:
            FOO: baz        # This will set FOO=baz in the build
    main2:                  # This will set FOO=bar in the build
        requires: [main]
```
