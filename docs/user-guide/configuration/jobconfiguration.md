# Job Configuration

Jobs are how you define what happens in every build. Every job configuration must consist of an `image` and a list of `steps`, or a `template`. It also defines trigger requirement for the job using `requires`. See [workflow](./workflow) for detailed usage of `requires` to create pipeline workflow.

#### Example

```
jobs:
    main:
        requires: [~pr, ~commit]
        image: node:lts
        steps:
            - init: npm install
            - test: npm test
    main2:
        requires: main
        template: example/mytemplate@stable
```

## Image

The `image` configuration refers to a docker image, e.g. an container from [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com). You can specify an image from a custom registry by specifying the full url to that image.

#### Example

```
jobs:
    main:
        requires: [~pr, ~commit]
        image: my-custom-registry.example.com/myorg/myimage:label
        steps:
            - step1: echo hello
```

## Steps

Steps are the list of instructions you want to execute in your build. These should be defined as:
`step_name: step_command`. Steps will be executed in the order they are defined. Current working directory and environment variables are passed between steps.

You can also specify user teardown steps, which will be run regardless of whether the build succeeds or fails. These steps need to be at the end of the job and should be prefixed with `teardown-`.

Example repo: <https://github.com/screwdriver-cd-test/user-teardown-example>

By default, instructions in steps are executed using the Bourne shell (`/bin/sh`). If you prefer your build to use a different shell, you can configure `USER_SHELL_BIN`. For instance, to use capabilities that Bash provides but the Bourne shell does not, specify `USER_SHELL_BIN: bash` in a job's environment.

#### Example

```
jobs:
    main:
        requires: [~pr, ~commit]
        image: node:lts
        environment:
            USER_SHELL_BIN: bash
        steps:
            - step_name: step_command --arg1 --arg2 foo
            - set_env: export FOO=bar
            - get_env: echo $FOO           # this will echo bar
            - cd: |
                pwd                        # prints '/sd/workspace/src/github.com/tkyi/mytest'
                cd ..
            - pwd: pwd                     # prints '/sd/workspace/src/github.com/tkyi'
            - bash-only: echo ${FOO%r}     # this will echo ba
            - fail: commanddoesnotexist
            - teardown-mystep1: echo goodbye
            - teardown-mystep2: echo world
```

### Teardown

The teardown steps run a set of Screwdriver bookend steps after the build steps are completed or aborted or failed. These steps are implicitly added at the end of job and start with `sd-teardown-` or `teardown-`. The pod/container is removed after these steps are completed. In case of aborted builds, we can also configure the grace period of the pod before termination during which the teardown steps will be executed. See the `screwdriver.cd/terminationGracePeriodSeconds` [annotation](/user-guide/configuration/annotations) for detailed usage.

### Template

You can also use [templates](../templates/job-templates) in a job configuration.

# Shared Configuration

The `shared` configuration is a special job configuration section that is applied to all jobs. Configuration that is specified in a job configuration will override the same configuration in `shared`.

#### Example

The following example defines a shared configuration for `image` and `steps`, which is used by the main and main2 jobs.

```
shared:
    image: node:lts
    steps:
        - init: npm install
        - pretest: npm lint
        - test: npm test

jobs:
    main:
        requires: [~pr, ~commit]
        image: node:lts
    main2:
        requires: [main]
        steps:
            - test: echo Skipping test
```

The above example would be equivalent to:

```
jobs:
    main:
        requires: [~pr, ~commit]
        image: node:lts
        steps:
            - init: npm install
            - pretest: npm lint
            - test: npm test
    main2:
        requires: [main]
        image: node:lts
        steps:
            - test: echo Skipping test

```
