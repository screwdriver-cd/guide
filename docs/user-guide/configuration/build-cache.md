# Build Cache
Top-level setting that contains file paths from your build that you would like to cache. The cache is stored in a build's teardown bookend and restored in a build's setup bookend. You can limit access to the cache using the pipeline, event or job scope.

| Scope  | Access |
|---|---|
| pipeline  | All builds in the same pipeline ![pipeline-scope](../assets/pipeline-scope.png)  |
| event  | All builds in the same event ![event-scope](../assets/event-scope.png) |
| job  | All builds for the same job ![job-scope](../assets/job-scope.png) |

## Example

```yaml
cache:
   pipeline: [~/.gradle]
   event: [$SD_SOURCE_DIR/node_modules]
   job:
       usejobcache: [/tmp/test]

jobs:
    setnpmcache:
        image: node:6
        steps:
            - install: npm install
        requires: [~commit, ~pr]
    usenpmcache:
        image: node:6
        steps:
            - ls: ls
            - install: npm install
        requires: [setnpmcache]
    usegradlecache:
        image: java:7
        steps:
            - ls: ls ~/
            - install: git clone https://github.com/gradle-guides/gradle-site-plugin.git && cd gradle-site-plugin && ./gradlew build
        requires: [~commit, ~pr]
    usejobcache:
        image: node:6
        steps:
            - ls-tmp: ls /tmp
            - echo: echo hi > /tmp/test
        requires: [~commit, ~pr]
```

In the above example, the pipeline-scoped `.gradle` cache can be accessed under all builds in the pipeline to save time on `gradle install`. For event-scoped cache, we cache the `node_modules` folder under the event scope in the `setnpmcache` build so that the downstream `usenpmcache` build can save time on `npm install`. For job-scoped cache, we cache `/tmp/test` file so that it is available for any subsequent builds of the same job.

## Notes
- If your cache is large and the cache bookend runs out of memory, you can set the `screwdriver.cd/ram` [annotation](./annotations) to `HIGH` to provide more memory to the build.

## Clearing the Cache
In order to clear the cache, you can go to the Options tab for your pipeline in the Screwdriver UI and click on the Trash icon under the Cache section.
